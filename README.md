# Etch-a-Sketch
This is a simple interactive web application that creates a dynamic grid of squares. Users can hover over squares to gradually change their color and opacity, and can also adjust the grid size via a button prompt.

## Objectives
- Practice creating and manipulating DOM elements dynamically using vanilla JavaScript
- Build an interactive grid-based drawing tool triggered by mouse hover events
- Implement a feature that allows users to adjust the grid size via prompt input
- Apply dynamic styling to elements, including size, background color, and opacity

## Features
- Default 16x16 grid (256 squares)
- Squares highlight in teal on hover
- Opacity increases gradually with repeated hover
- Button to reset and resize the grid (from 4×4 up to 100×100)

## Key Topics Learned
This project reinforced core front-end development skills, including creating and manipulating DOM elements dynamically with JavaScript, handling user input and validation, and applying real-time visual changes using event listeners. It also provided hands-on practice with CSS Flexbox for responsive layouts, styling elements programmatically, and implementing interactivity through hover effects. Additionally, it emphasized writing clean, modular code and improving the user experience through input-driven customization.
